# Snowbacca

Totally not Chewbacca.

This hero's concept was made by my uncle. I merely wrote
it down and helped him flesh out the abilities.

## Abilities

###Throw snowball
 - Linear projectile
 - explodes on hit
 - area damage
 - freeze the target, slow surrounding targets

### Make exploding snowmen
 - Build a snowman very quickly
 - Can have up to three at a time
   - this is enforced by cooldown/duration 
 - When the duration runs out, three staggered explosions
   - also fire a projectile in a random direction on the last explosion
   - projectile deals damage
 - When an enemy walks into them, they explode all at once

### Summon ankle-biting kobolds
 - summon 5 uncontrollable kobolds
 - they start with more HP than Snowbacca
   - but they lose HP over time
 - attack modifier: bite ankle
   - slow the target
   - chance to poison
     - mana degen
     - kobold is healed for a % of mana drained
     - lasts as long as the kobold is alive and expires 5 seconds after kobold dies
 - can throw rocks:
   - tracking projectile
   - small amount of physical damage
 - leave a stinky cloud/puddle on death
   - damage over time

###Pew pew
 - Shoots 3/6/9 snowballs
   - identical to Throw Snowball
   - multishot
     - sweeping from side to side
      - one shot every 0.1 seconds or something
 - Snowbacca has extra life while shooting

## General stats

Ranged attack, 600ish range

Strength is primary attribute

Kinda slow, maybe 290 or so movespeeds

Could use Tusk as base hero?
