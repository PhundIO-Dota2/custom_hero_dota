# Abberath, the Cloven Soul

## Abilities

### Meteor Storm

> *Ground Target, Channeled*

Abberath calls down a shower of meteors over the target area, growing in power as he channels.

 - Every 0.1 seconds while channeling, a meteor will strike a random location within the target area.
 - Meteor radius and meteor damage are each increased by 10% for every second spent channeling.
 - The channel time bonuses are applied linearly

| 28/25/22/19 second cooldown | 90/100/110/120 mana + 10 per second |
|---|---|
| Maximum channel duration | 8 seconds |
| Area radius | 220 |
| Meteor radius | 20/22/24/26 |
| Damage per meteor | 10/13/16/19 + 30% of Strength |

### God's Step

> *Toggle*

Abberath's hooves shake the ground, damaging nearby enemies with each step he takes.

 - Triggers for every 50 units that Abberath moves under his own power (i.e. while not affected by any motion-controlling modifiers).
 - Does not trigger if Abberath moves more than 2000 units in 0.09 seconds.
 - Uses mana each time it triggers

| No cooldown | No cost |
|---|---|
| Radius | 240/280/320/360 |

| Mana cost per 100 units | 10/12/14/16 |

### Heat Shroud

> *No target*

Abberath surrounds himself with torrid air. If Abberath is damaged by a nearby enemy, the shroud reflects a portion of the damage back to the attacker.

### Consume Soul

> *Ultimate*

Attempt to feast on the target's soul, instantly killing a non-ancient creep or dealing massive pure damage to a hero.
If the target is killed by Consume Soul, Abberath permanently gains bonus Strength. Heroes give **5** times as much Strength.
