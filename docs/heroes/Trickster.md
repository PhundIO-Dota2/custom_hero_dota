# Rubick, the Trickster

Uses Rubick's model (duh).

## Abilities

### Dancing Lights

Rubick creates a handful of dancing balls of light at a location. The lights damage any enemy they come in contact with and blind them, causing their attacks to miss.
 - The balls move around randomly within the target area.

| 14/13/12/11 second cooldown | 75/90/105/120 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 4 seconds |
| Number of lights | 4 |
| Damage | 40/60/80/100 |
| Miss chance | 35/40/45/50% |
| Blind duration | 2 seconds |

### Switcheroo

Rubick instantly phases out of the world while creating an illusion of himself. The illusion appears in Rubick's current position
and mimics his last action before he cast Switcheroo. While phased out, Rubick can reactivate this ability to reappear at the location of the illusion.
 - Rubick only remains phased out while channeling. Taking any action breaks the channel.
 - The illusion's duration is equal to the channel duration, but the illusion is not destroyed if the channel ends early.
 - Teleporting to the illusion destroys it.
 - The illusion can be controlled.

| 22/17/12/7 second cooldown | 100/90/80/70 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds (channeled) |
| Illusion damage taken | 400% |
| Illusion damage dealt | 20% |

### Confuse

Whenever Rubick casts a spell, nearby enemies become Confused. Confused enemies' abilities cost more mana and their cooldowns are longer. Confuse lasts 4 seconds and stacks.

| Passive | |
|---|---|
| Duration | 4 seconds |
| Mana cost increase | 5/6/7/8% |
| Cooldown increase | 5/6/7/8% |
| Maximum stacks | 3 |

### Mimic (ult subability)

Rubick mimics his Studied target's most recently cast spell with a target of his choice. The spell appears to originate from the Studied target.
 - Can be cast irrespective of the original ability's cooldown and mana cost.
 - Cannot cast the same ability twice within that ability's original cooldown time.

| 24/12/6 second cooldown | Mana cost is equal to 100/80/60% of the original ability's cost |
|---|---|

### Study (ult)

Rubick studies an enemy hero's spellcasting, allowing him to Mimic it in a limited fashion.
- Places a debuff on the target; if the target has cast a spell during this instance of the debuff, Mimic is enabled.

| 60/45/30 second cooldown | 50 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 60 second |
| Cast range | 550/750/950 |
