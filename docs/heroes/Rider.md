# The Rider

Replaces Chaos Knight.

The Rider is a tanky initiator who becomes more threatening the more damage he takes.

## Abilties

### Charge

Activate to gain movement speed while moving towards a visible enemy. Charge ends when the Rider collides with an enemy hero;
doing so will deal physical damage to the victim and stun it as well as other enemies in a small area.
 - The Rider must be within 50° of facing towards an enemy hero to gain the movement speed, but still gains half the benefit while within 70°.
 - Stun is centered between the Rider and his victim.

| Radius | 200 |
| Damage | 80/120/160/200 |
| Stun duration | 1/1.5/2/2.5 |

### Vengeance

Every time a nearby allied hero takes damage from an enemy hero, an echo of that damage is generated.
The echoes orbit the Rider and empower him, granting bonus attack damage equal to a percentage of their damage.
Activate this ability to launch each echo back towards its creator; the echo deals a portion of its damage to the first enemy unit it collides with.
 - Echoes are drawn towards the Rider on creation
 - The echoes will mimic the victim's movements, but stay within the aura's radius.
 - The return damage counts as reflect damage (like Blademail), meaning it cannot be reflected, lifestealed from, or amplified.

### Challenge

The Rider challenges an enemy hero, increasing the damage they deal to each other and reducing the damage they deal to any other units.
 - The Rider can only challenge one enemy at a time.
 - The debuff on the challenged enemy can be removed by a strong dispel; this also removes the buff on the Rider.
 - The buff on the Rider cannot be purged (except as mentioned above).
 - Persists through death.

### Heroic Sacrifice

Redirect all damage from nearby allied heroes to the Rider. If the Rider dies during Last Stand, he releases a shockwave
that deals damage to all enemies in a large area based on the total damage the Rider absorbed during Last Stand.
Every hero killed by the shockwave reduces the Rider's respawn time.
