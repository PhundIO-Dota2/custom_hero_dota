# Shielder

A drain-tank with a unique defensive mechanic.
He's inspired by Path of Exile's Energy Shield mechanic, which is a buffer over health that can't be refilled by potions, regeneration or lifesteal unless invested into; but he ended up rather different.

Much like Medusa, he uses mana as a defensive mechanic; unlike her, he has a way to refill it, and his mana-shield is more powerful in that he will never die unless his mana is depleted.

Thus, Energy Shield is his core mechanic.

Essence Drain, Ghost Reaver and Spirit Bleed came about as a way to satisfy the slowing drain-tank aesthetic.

Chaos Nova emphasizes the need to build a large combined health- and mana-pool; note that it isn't quite as dangerous as it first appears, because the health and mana lost can be leeched back with Ghost Reaver immediately. So if you hit the entire enemy team, you will do massive damage and come out fine; if you hit nothing, you'll be left on one health and die to just about anything.
