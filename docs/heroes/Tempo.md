# Tempo, the Master of the Arcane

Built around his ultimate, which reduces all other spells' cooldowns whenever he casts a spell.

## Abilities
### Force Wave

Tempo fires a wave of force that damages enemies it collides with and knocks them back.

| 8.75/8/7.25/6.5 second cooldown | 85/100/115/130 mana |
|---|---|


Shoot a wave of forces that damages enemies and knocks them back.
 - knockback is minor, no other disable
 - possible talents/aghs upgrades:
   - add silence/disarm/root/slow/etc to the wave

### Arcane Mark
Applies an arcane mark to an enemy unit that deals periodic damage in an area around the target. When the mark deals damage,
it also spreads to a random nearby unaffected unit.
 - Deals damage once every 0.25 seconds
 - Can only spread to the same enemy once per cast
 - Multiple applications of Arcane Mark stack fully
 - possible talents/aghs upgrades:
   - can spread to allies (still only damages enemies)
   - spreads to all nearby targets/more than just one

### Augment
Empowers your spells, adding damage to each hit dealt. The buff is removed one second after you next cast a spell.
 - Lasts a few seconds (somewhere between 5 and 10) otherwise

### Cooldown manipulation
 - Whenever you cast a spell, reduce all OTHER spells' cooldowns by ??? sec
