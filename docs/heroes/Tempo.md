# Tempo, the Master of the Arcane

Built around his ultimate, which reduces all other spells' cooldowns whenever he casts a spell.

## Abilities

### Arcane Mark

it also spreads to a random nearby unaffected unit.

   - can spread to allies (still only damages enemies)
   - spreads to all nearby targets/more than just one

### Augment
