# Cyre, Captain of the Stormkiller

## Abilities

### Assemble Turret

Deploys an immobile turret. The turret has a damaging attack and replicates Cyre's spells.

### Stasis Field

Creates a field that roots units caught in it. Each hero caught in the field reduces Cyre's cooldowns.

Also creates a smaller field around each turret.

### Aether Blast

A narrow cone of blue flame that deals damage and applies a mana-draining DoT effect.

Each turret also fires an Aether Bolt at the closest enemy hero, dealing damage and applying the same debuff.

### Orbital Cannon

Opens a portal to the ship's main cannon, dealing massive magical damage in a long line-shaped AoE.

Also grants each turret bonus damage on its next attack.
