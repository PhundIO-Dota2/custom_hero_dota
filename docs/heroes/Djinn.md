## Abilities

### Flame Path
Sets a target area on fire. While on a Flame Path,
Djinn gains increased movement speed and can pass
through units. Enemies on a Flame Path take damage over time.

Has no cooldown, but uses Djinn's Inner Flame.

| No cooldown | 20 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 4 seconds |
| Movement speed bonus | 18/24/30/36% |
| Damage per second | 40/60/80/100 |
| Radius | 240/270/300/330 |
| Cast range | 425/500/575/650 |
| Inner Flame usage | 12/11/10/9 |

### Intense Heat

Djinn lets his Inner Flame flare up, increasing its regeneration rate and burning
nearby enemies. While Intense Heat is active, Djinn can use Deflagration.

| 20/18/16/14 second cooldown | 70/80/90/100 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 5/7/9/11 seconds |
| Damage per second | 50/65/80/95 |
| Inner Flame regen bonus | 20/30/40/50 |
| Radius | 425 |

### Deflagration

Djinn instantly ends Intense Heat and unleashes an expanding ring of fire
that deals damage based on his Inner Flame.

| No cooldown | 30 mana |
|---|---|
| Damage | 90/110/130/150 |
| Damage per 10 Flame | 10/12/14/16 |
| Expansion speed | 700 |
| End radius | 700 |
| Ring width | 90 |

### Ember Might

Djinn's Inner Flame amplifies his attacks and abilities, granting bonus
attack damage and increased spell damage based on his Inner Flame level.

| Passive | |
|---|---|
| Attack damage per 10 Flame | 2/3.5/5/6.5 |
| Spell damage per 10 Flame | 0.6/0.9/1.2/1.5 |

### Inner Flame

Djinn's inner flame is the source of his power. He generates Inner Flame
over time based on how much he's missing, up to a maximum. 

| Passive | Innate | 
|---|---|
| Maximum Flame | 100 |
| Flame generation at 0 Flame | 20 |
| Flame generation at 100 Flame | 4 |

### Caldera

Incinerate is kind of bad and doesn't fit the hero well. Alternative ult:

Djinn projects his Inner Flame outward, creating a zone of heated air surrounded by a ring of fire. Allies in the zone gain cooldown reduction and benefit from Ember Might; while in the zone, the effect of Ember Might on Djinn is doubled. Enemies standing in the ring of fire take damage per second.

| 130/120/110 second cooldown | 175/225/275 mana |
|---|---|
| Duration | 7/8/9 seconds |
| Cooldown reduction | 10/13/16% |
| Zone radius | 550 |
| Ring width | 200 |
| Cast range | 500 |
| Damage per second | 80/100/120 |

## Talents

| 25 | 1.5x Ember Might | +25% Cooldown Reduction |
| 20 | +30 maximum Inner Flame | +20 Flame Path DPS |

| 10 | +8 Strength | +175 mana |

## Notes/balance concerns

### Flame Path/Inner Flame/Ember Might

The intended gameplay is that Djinn needs to choose between staying at low IF levels to spam Flame Path more, or staying at high IF levels to gain more dmaage from Ember Might.

With current numbers, the choice isn't really there: FP is too cheap compared to IF regen, and Ember Might isn't strong enough to compensate for losing the high regen.
